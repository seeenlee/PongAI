### PongAI

## What it does
PongAI was supposed to be a bot that never lost a game of Pong. However, as the project progressed, we realized we could create a full-fledged game along with multiple game modes. Currently, our version of Pong has a singleplayer (easy and hard mode), multiplayer, training, and survival modes. 

## Challenges we ran into
The main problem that we ran into was the UI. Due to our limited experience with Pygame and Python in general, we had to learn everything as we coded. The main problem with the UI was that we were unable to call the functions without the computer lagging. We were able to figure out how to make the game work, but we could not create a working UI and menu. However, 15 minutes before this project was due, we were able to fix some indentation and now it works! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even through our challenges, we are proud of how much we accomplished. Not only did we achieve our goal of creating a bot that plays Pong, we were able to create an entire game behind it. Our most proudest achievement is that we were able to create the game, menu, and UI all on our own. We did not follow a tutorial nor did we get inspiration from another person's code. We started from scratch and created our game of Pong!
